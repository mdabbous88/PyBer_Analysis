# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

PyBer company is conducting an analysis on data collected to examine the relation between different city type(urban, rural and suburban) and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares riders and drivers by type of city. Analysis is to be concducted and visualizations are to be produced.

## Results
The key differences between types of ride-sharing among city types:
*Urban cities have the highest total rides whereas the rural cities have the lowest total rides.

*The rural cities have the lowest number of drivers where as the urban cities have the highest.

*The total fares fares are highest in urban cities and lowest in rural cities

*The ride fare is the highest in rural cities and lowest in urban cities.

*The fare by driver is highest in rural areas and lowest in urban areas.

*The suburban cities have always been in the middle between the rural cities and urban cities in all the indicators represented in the snapshot.

## Summary
Three main recommendations can be concluded from the above analysis:

1-Urban areas have very high number of drivers 2405 and the total rides have been much less 1625 rides. This means that there is excess drivers in these areas, and the can be relocated to other city types.

2-The average fare per driver and the average fare per ride are much higher in rural areas and suburban areas compared to urban areas.  These fares need to be reduced to allow more people use this ridesharing service.

3-The figure shows no seasonality and the demand on the risdesharing service is constant as shows in the graph. It is recommended to keep a constant number of drivers and not move drivers between city types during the year after performing recommendation 1.
